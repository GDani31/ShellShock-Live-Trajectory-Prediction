To use this script, place your mosue above your tank and then press 'g' to start the trajectory plotter.
Pressing 'f' will reset the plotter to power=100 and angle=90.

You need to start by setting your tank 100,90 and then press 'g' while mouse is hovering above your tank.
Pressing the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard will change the direction of your aim and the script will also change its plot direction to match the tank.
Pressing the up and down arrow keys will also change the power for the tank and for the script.
